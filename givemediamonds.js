// You need to return a string that displays a diamond shape on the screen using asterisk ("*") characters. Please see provided test cases for exact output format.
//
// The shape that will be returned from print method resembles a diamond, where the number provided as input represents the number of *’s printed on the middle line. The line above and below will be centered and will have 2 less *’s than the middle line. This reduction by 2 *’s for each line continues until a line with a single * is printed at the top and bottom of the figure.
//
// Return null if input is even number or negative (as it is not possible to print diamond with even number or negative number).

function diamond(n){
  if (n < 0 || n % 2 == 0) return null;
  for (var i = 0, diamond = ''; i < n; i++) {
    var stars = n - Math.abs(n - 2*i - 1);
    var spaces = (n - stars) / 2;
    while (spaces-- > 0) diamond += ' ';
    while (stars-- > 0) diamond += '*';
    diamond += '\n';
  }
  return diamond;
